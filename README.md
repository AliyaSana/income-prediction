Predicting Income Level using ML classifiers.
This project focuses on predicting whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000 using classification-based machine learning models. Leveraging the Adult Census Income dataset, we aim to identify significant demographic and employment-related features that influence income levels. The project progresses through three stages: data understanding and preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation. During the initial phase, comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to understand data patterns, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features appropriately. Multiple classification algorithms were then trained and tested, including Logistic Regression, kNearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with additional exploration into Gradient Boosting and XGBoost models. Each model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Hyperparameter tuning was also conducted for selected models to optimize performance. The findings of this project can support informed decisionmaking in financial, social, and governmental dom
